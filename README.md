# Introduction to TypeScript

## How to run this exercise locally

Once you have cloned this repository locally, you'll need to install all dependencies for this project. You can do this  via your terminal by navigating to your local project and then running:

`npm install`

You should then be able to run the tests for the exercise by running:

`npm run test-exercise`

Expect to see red text complaining about errors until you have fixed all of the problems within `src/exercise.ts`.

There are TypeScript examples within `src/examples` should you need a hint.

Best of luck!
